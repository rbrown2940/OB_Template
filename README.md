# What is Obsidian?
<details>
<summary></summary>

**The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.**

**In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.**

# Project Description
<details>
<summary></summary>

The project OB_Templates is an <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> template repository that started on the 25th of December 2021.

Since the start of the project there have been many change. Since it started as a gathering place for all my templates, soon it have become a project aimed at new users in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> with a very important rule. **All templates must use only the core plugins of Obsidian**

With time i found that <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">DataView</a> have become a essential to every user, although i try to keep it as basic as possible not to confuse new users.

All the available templates are not designed to be perfect, they are intended to be used as a reference for any user to build on them or to take ideas when building you're own templates.

I have converted coffee into this repository. If you think it was worth it, consider helping me buy more coffee: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/llzektorll"> PayPal </a>

# Usage
<details>
<summary></summary>

OB_Templates it's not a vault template, this is simply a folder of templates to be added in your vault. 

You can add the templates to your vault in different ways, these are some of my easiest examples.

1. Download the repository, extract the files and add to your vault.
2. Go to a specific template and copy the text (Make sure you open in raw mode) and copy the text to a file in your vault.

# FAQ
<details>
<summary></summary>

	❓ - How do I add the templates?

A: Simply copy the templates folder or the specific template file to your vault.

	❓ - How do I use the templates?

A: As a general rule, most templates need to be "Imported". In other words, make sure you have at least Obsidian native templates option enabled and configured.

	❓ - Can I contribute to the repository?

A: YES! You are free to submit any template you use.

	❓ - Can I clone the repository?

A: Yes, just make sure to leave the credits.

	❓ - Are there any prerequisite plugins to use the templates?

A: Yes and No. I'm assuming you already have <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">DataView</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian">Advanced Tables</a>. But it does not hurt to have <a href="https://github.com/Aidurber/obsidian-plugin-dynamic-toc">Dynamic Table of Contents</a>.

	❓ - What is the meaning of the Tags?

A: All the Tags in the templates are just examples. You can add or remove any Tags you would like. Here is somewhere to learn more about <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+tags">how to work with Tags in Obsidian</a>.

	❓ - My question/issue is not listed here, how can I get an answer?

A: For any queries please head to the Obsidian forum and check the <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-notes-template/28940">OB_Template Thread</a>, I will answer as fast as possible.
